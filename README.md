These are just a few images. There are no buttons like in the original logitech app.
Some things are also missing because i don't know how to add them. Example the border between ADD DEVICE and USER Profile.
This is just a fun little simple project for my afternoon.
If you want to make it better do it but then show me.

Well, it's time to get back to learning.
